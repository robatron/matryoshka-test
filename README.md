# Matryoshka test

Test your browser's ability to handle absurd numbers of nested elements.

[Matryoshkify now](http://robatron.github.com/matryoshka-test)!


### Why?

My coworkers and I wanted to explore some interesting browser-specifc
nested-element behavior when viewing bloated
[SharePoint](http://sharepoint.microsoft.com) pages.

Also, because Fridays are meant for silly projects.
